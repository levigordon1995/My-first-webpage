        <h2>Unit 1.1/1.2|The Purpose Of IT in Modern Business</h2>
        <p class="unit1h">IT has become integral in the 21st century.</b> Some of the tools used are essential in certain sectors of modern business. I feel communication is more important now than it was in the 20th century,
        more importantly the speed of the communication. So apps like Slack and Trello are very useful as groups of people can reach out to one and other to problem solve or collaborate together while not having to be in the same space physically. 
    The luxury of being able to communicate with tens of people at a time from the click of a button be it with your phone or laptop is amazing as business can resume even in the middle of worlwide pandemic.

    <h2>Unit 1.3|What do you need so that projects are successful</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
            <p class="unit13">In terms of tools, it is essential that if you are to be successful at working any project in modern business you need to have a mobile source of communication; be it a laptop or smart phone. This is needed as theres alot more competition in terms of businesses that are competing in each industry. Time is of the essence in business and creatives and innovators have caught on
            so now we have apps like Gmail, Zoom, Trello and Slack. All in which I reccomend at some point if your project is complex with a vast group of people who have differing roles and opinions. 
            In terms of skills, having strong communication skills are very important in the world business; more so in the tech business as one minor mistake could ruin an entire project as computers deal with matter of fact rather than opinion. So its essential that people working on big projects in the tech industry are precise and sharp with there use of Trello or Slack as clear definition of tasks is paramount</p>

    <h3>How will you plan it?</h3>
                <br>
                <br>
        <p class="unit135">In order to plan a project I would first conduct a Zoom meeting to discuss each team members role. Each role is defined so that we can go over our individual responsibilities with a sense of clarity. It is essential that we dont waste time taking on each others workload accidentally so a Trello is essential if we wish to be successful
        Here's an example of my Trello board. I feel this is very important because each member can edit there responsibilities so that everyone is updated without having to conduct another group meeting. Once this is done and everyones clear on there roles and ready to work; anyone 
        dealing with any difficulties can go to the Slack chat and reach out for help. This is good as the chat saves the thread so if that member or others are experiencing similar difficulties they can go back and refer to the chat as a guide. 
        </p>

        <h4>Unit 1.4| What causes digital projects to fail?</h4>
        <p class="unit14">When it boils down to digital projects, the fundamentals are particularly important. Making sure you have a charger present for both your smart phone and laptop is essential when working on digital projects as those are the main tools you will need in order to succeed. A plumber cannot work on your kitchen sink with his bare hands, he needs his tools at some point to get the job done; This is the same as anyone working on a digital project. So after you have made sure your digital devices are charged you will need to test them to make sure there aren’t any bugs or viruses that could hinder the speed of your progress in which you’d like to achieve when working on your digital project. This is very much essential with all digital devices but more so when it comes to laptops and computers as the user typically exposes them to sites and apps that possess a potent enough virus to crash your digital device. 
            Another aspect to consider when discussing failure in digital projects is Wi-fi connection. Being in the tech industry mid pandemic gives us an advantage as we can work remotely more so than others and achieve the exact same results all be it, we have our digital devices. Those results will be severely hindered if Wi-Fi connection is weak or you have none.

            <h5>Unit 1.5| How do you go about picking the right IT systems and software for the job?</h5>
            <p class="unit15">Firstly, you’ll need to establish the roles in which the job requires; and also figure out if it’s a job you could do yourself or one in which you need to break up into various roles. This is so that team members can work individually as a way of being time effective. Once the type of tools needed are distinguished, then we can go about picking the correct ones for the job. If I am working on a complex project with colleagues I haven’t worked with before, having a Trello board is essential as each member can monitor their own progress as well as oversee the progress of the whole project which brings clarity. However, if I am working on a project that is not complex and my group of colleagues are trustworthy in terms of capability and work rate then a WhatsApp group will suffice as they don’t need the structured format of Trello and Slack to understand where we are in terms of progress regarding the project. However, I would always use Trello to set tasks as the format is extremely helpful when setting tasks

                <h6>Unit 1.6| How my chosen technologies helped me achieve my goals</h6>
                <p class="unit16">In previous projects I would conduct stand ups via Zoom as a way of problem solving whenever someone was struggling with a specific code or we needed clarity on something that we could not explain through text. The share screen option is helpful as all the team members were able to chime in and give their expertise on the matter. I would use Trello as a way of connecting each member role on the same page. It gave me a broader perspective of the project which is helpful as one can be very tied down to their own specific role which gives a lack of foresight when having to connect your role to one of another team member.

                    <h7 class="unit17h">Unit 1.7| How does GDPR affect digital projects?</h7>
                    <br>
                    <p class="unit17">GDPR also known as General Data Protection Regulation has helped even the score in terms of how much privacy an individual has when browsing the internet and using social media. Corporations and social media companies would exchange the personal data of there customers in order to gauge a clearer understanding of what promote or display to the customer. As the new age of the internet arose the rules and laws never caught up with the times until an adjustment to the Data Protection Act 2018 was made which gave any party involved in illegally accessing or exchanging personal data a hefty fine of 20 million pounds or a 4% deduction of the companies yearly turnover whichever is higher at the time. This now means anyone taking part in any digital projects that involve personal data has to make sure they follow the rules and the law precisely as it could ruin their entire business. This is good for the consumer as they can browse the internet freely compared to when this law wasn’t active.

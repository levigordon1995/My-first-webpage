            <h2>Unit 2.1| Am I happy with the tools used in my project?</h2>
        <p class="unit21">I am incredibly pleased with the tools I used in my project. Slack and Visual code have run smoothly and the options you have within them both are vast and useful. 
            In Visual code I can code in Python, HTML and CSS at the same time. I find that extremely helpful as each form of code is very much unique and has its own power but does not overlap. I find that very impressive as it is a hub for all my code. 
            In terms of Slack and Trello, they both have been particularly useful as I can see what everyone is up to and how close they are to their goals. 
        </p>

        <h2>Unit 2.2| Were the tools appropriate?</h2>
        <p class="unit22">I feel all tools were appropriate in this specific project besides Trello as I am working alone so the need to document what I haven’t done, what I’m doing and what is already done is quite excessive as I am a productive worker when alone. 
            I also have a time constraint so updating my Trello regularly when having to get the done is seen as a chore if I feel I’m capable without it. However, it is something I will still use in future solo project 
        </p>

        <h3>Unit 2.3/2.4| Are you happy with your website?</h3>
        <p class="unit234">Bearing in mind I had no knowledge of CSS or Html a week ago, I am pleased with how my website has ended up. I wasn’t sure how it would turn out but at the moment for my first attempt at creating a webpage with different functions and a design is something I feel I can be proud of. 
            I could have made improvements though if given more time. I would have created animation that pops up whenever I hover the mouse over a button. I feel that would have added some authenticity but I’m still happy overall with my achievement as I’ve gained a transferrable skill that I can use in the tech business from now on.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Unit 3.1/3.2| Could I have been more efficient?</h4>
        <p class="unit312">I feel I could have been more efficient in the time spent pondering what to write up and how I wanted to format my website instead of building a skeleton to work around that I can go back on and tweak while making my website look appealing. 
            Procrastinating hindered my progress as I thought I was being productive as I was thinking about what to do before I done it but when the workload began to build I found myself playing a game of catch up in order to stay afloat which is not my style so in future I will start working on a template of what I think will work so that in future I don’t find myself in a similar position. 
            Working in a team would have been amazing as each task would be fulfilling as you get to see the results straight away even if there are errors. This isn’t the case when working on Python as errors do not allow the coder to see what the finished product could look like. I would have enjoyed this project just as much as I have if it were team based
        </p>

        <h5>Unit 3.3/3.4| Solutions to more productivity</h5>
        <p class="unit334">I would have set myself a time limit to how long I work on my solo project as that would have given me incentive to get as much done as possible. 
            I also would have made a Trello that combines my solo project with my life outside of work. For example I would post when I needed to prepare dinner or see family and what I would need to have that done by; that way any road blocks that emerge be it work or social life I can document and work around it. 
            I would go about testing these methods by attempting them with other work projects or areas of social life that aren’t quite planned out and see how effective it is and how much I follow or stray away. I think it will help as I wouldn’t want to go against myself when I know I documented everything to stay productive.
